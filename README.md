# DoneRight a Kanban Board Application

This is a **DoneRight** Kanban board application built using React JS that allows users to dynamically adjust the Kanban board based on their grouping and sorting preferences. Users can group tickets by status, user, or priority, and sort the displayed tickets by priority or title. The application also retains the user's view state even after page reload, ensuring a smooth and personalized experience.

## Features

- Group tickets by status, user, or priority.
- Sort tickets by priority or title.
- Visually appealing and responsive design.
- Ability to save the user's view state in local storage for persistence.
- Priority levels are defined as:
  - Urgent (4)
  - High (3)
  - Medium (2)
  - Low (1)
  - No priority (0).
